Unlike the other chatbots of the time, however, Tay was meant to have a personality, and to have a sense of humour, engaging in “casual and playful conversation”.\nYet, in a few hours of release, the conversations were somewhat less “playful”:\nBy 4 am the next day Microsoft had shut down Tay – only 16 hours after it had launched.\nMicrosoft may have had a great idea. Tay was meant to learn from its interactions, becoming more advanced with each interaction with a user. But they seemingly didn’t account for one crucial thing – the data itself may be bad.\nBut dirty data is not just hate speech, or outliers. It’s more than that. And understanding how to clean data is essential to ensure your data tells an accurate story\nWhat is dirty data Microsoft’s chatbot fell prey to data bias, a problem most AI and predictive systems are affected by. If the dataset used to train an AI excludes certain groups, or has inherent societal biases, these systems may exacerbate societal biases.\nThink of the infamous Titanic dataset. Within a few minutes of Exploratory Data Analysis, you would realise that females were vastly more likely to survive than men. If a travel insurance firm trained its system using the Titanic dataset, it would charge men markedly higher premiums than women. With that, a system meant to assess risk based on the destination of travel and number of people travelling, instead assesses risk based on gender.\nThis may sound hypothetical, but banks have been charging, on average, higher interest rates to people of colour. This may have been caused, in part, by AI systems that consider black borrowers riskier.\nHow to (try) clean dirty data It’s true that data will never be clean – it will always have some level of bias and error, but by systematically evaluating the source, freshness, and attributes of the data being collected, bias and error can be reduced considerably.\nBut how can this be done? To borrow from Kathy Baxter’s very good article: We can evaluate the correctness of data by asking 4 W’s – Where, When, Who, and What?\nWHERE – Is your data source credible? The quality of your data is very important, and so it is crucial to consider where your data comes from. Could that source have a vested interest in having the data be a certain way? Might they have tweaked the data? It is very important that you get your data from a trusted, credible source.\nIf you’re collecting the data yourself: have you followed the proper procedures for collecting data systematically? Could the sample you collected the data from introduce bias into the data? These are all very key considerations to make your data credible.\nIf you’re starting out in Data Science and are looking for credible, real-world datasets, public datasets from The World Bank, Google, and the US Census Bureau will do the job.\nWHEN – Is your data source recent? You’ve probably heard that the total amount of data in the world doubles every two years. It’s an incredible statistic, but one of the problems with this is that there is way more data about the recent past than the more distant past.\nFor example, a stock trading bot maker would have way more information about the movements in the stock market in the last month, than they would have of 5 years ago.\nThis phenomenon is called recency bias, and while it can make your AI system good at finding short-term trends, it may falter on the more long-term, bigger-picture trends.\nHowever, the opposite is also true: a medical insurance firm making decisions based on data collected 5 years ago may not take into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic we’re still in the midst of.\nYou will need to take into account the recency of your data, and decide if it is appropriate for your particular use case.\nWHO – Is your data source representative? Your dataset needs to be representative of your target users/customers. For example, if an insurance firm was targeting European clients, it would not make sense to train their system with a dataset of American customers.\nBut it’s not often that easy to know if your dataset is representative:\nPeople of colour have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. While the COVID-19 vaccine trials were markedly more diverse, this was still observable. This was not intentional – hospitals typically found in POC neighbourhoods tend to be underfunded and therefore unable to conduct trials. Pharmaceutical companies also accounted for age in these trials. Even though people over the age of 65 make up just 9% of the US population, they are vastly more likely to die of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies have therefore included a disproportionate amount of older people in vaccine trials.\nWHAT – Could the data categories you are analysing have an inherent bias? Data categories are the different pieces of information or variables you are analysing - things like name, age, or location. Choosing what data categories to include is important because the presence of certain variables could introduce bias into your dataset.\nDue to certain laws, or organizational values, certain attributes are restricted:\nAge Race Gender National origin Sexual orientation These variables are prohibited in certain contexts like employing people or providing government services. Organisations tend to avoid them because they tend to introduce unwanted bias. It is generally advisable to stay away from these attributes unless your use case is specifically linked to them (e.g. for research purposes).\nIt is true that data will never be clean, but that doesn’t mean it can’t still be useful.\nTo quote Dean Abbott, “No data is clean, but most is useful.”\nSo, go on and make your data useful!

India and China’s opposition to the commitment to “phasing out” coal in the Glasgow Climate Pact (COP26) made a previously strong agreement much weaker. And while it no doubt caused disappointment and anger among other delegates (the conference’s president even fighting back tears), it also highlighted an issue in climate economics. Part of why politicians are reluctant to do anything about climate change is the fear that it would hurt economic growth.\nBut what if we thought about this a different way? What if not fixing climate change would be more disastrous to the economy?\nImpacts of leaving climate change unchecked To understand how climate change could hurt the global economy, we first have to understand what’s in store for us if climate change is left unchecked. I will use the US economy for reference, with data from the NRDC’s “The Cost of Climate Change” report.\nWarmer seas will result in stronger, more destructive storms, causing destructive floods that would destroy infrastructure. The estimated cost to the US economy is estimated to be upwards of $400 billion.\nThe flipside of this - less rainfall to many parts of the US - will mean many parts of the country will be left without a reliable water source. Providing water to these parts of the country will cost almost $1 trillion. Rising temperatures will cause demand for energy to skyrocket, requiring investments of hundreds of billions of US Dollars in new power plants.\nThese few impacts alone will cost the US economy more than $1 trillion, but estimates say the US economy could lose up to 4% of GDP annually, meaning the cumulative cost could be in the tens of trillions.\nWith this shocking revelation, let’s now look at the cost of avoiding all this.\nImpacts of dealing with climate change It’s hard to tell exactly how much dealing with climate change would cost, mostly because it’s not a clear goal. What does it mean? Decarbonising? What about all the waste we produce? Or the large scale deforestation of rainforests?\nThe obvious first step would be to begin generating all our electricity from renewable sources. This would require investments of between $8 trillion and $13 trillion. The next step would be to transition all the things we use fossil fuels for, to electricity. This would include cars, indoor heating, cooking, manufacturing, and would presumably require billions of dollars of investments.\nIn the long term, such policies would create millions of new jobs to replace the ones lost to decarbonisation. The innovation spurred by decarbonisation could accelerate economic growth, this time without jeopardising the planet’s future. But in a society where short-termism prevails, implementing such policies is difficult.\nThe figures used in this article are highly speculative, and I only use the US economy for reference, but the goal of this article was to challenge you to rethink the conversations we have about decarbonising. Reducing global emissions is going to be a hard and painful journey, but not doing anything may be more painful - both to our economy and to the planet.\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/post-2/","title":"The gold standard is a terrible idea.

The US had just been taken off the gold standard temporarily by Richard Nixon in 1971, and in the years that followed prices rose up to 14% annually. Proponents of the gold standard saw this as proof that the government could not be trusted to regulate the money supply. In their view, vote-seeking politicians might print money, inducing short term economic growth, but causing inflation in the long term.\nThe solution to this, according to proponents of the gold standard, was to return to the system that existed up to 1971: restrict the amount of dollars printed to the amount of gold in reserve; that is, each dollar should be convertible to a certain amount of gold.\nThis gives the government discipline because they have to keep enough gold in reserves to allow anyone to convert their dollars to gold. In the 20th century, this system did keep inflation low and stable in the long term. However, inflation was very volatile in the short term, and many economists say such a system is not suitable for the modern financial system.\nIn the years that have followed The Great Inflation (as the period of high inflation came to be known), the US has had remarkably low and stable inflation (averaging 4%).\nSupport for the gold standard is now diminished, and it is the general consensus among economists that the gold standard would be bad. However, some people (like Donald Trump) still support a return to it.\nHere’s why a gold standard is a bad idea.\nThe price of gold is very volatile One argument in favour of a gold standard is that it guarantees price stability.\nTo understand why a gold standard does not guarantee price stability, it helps to look at what a gold standard really is. The definition of a gold standard is a currency that is “freely convertible at home or abroad into a fixed amount of gold per unit of currency” (Britannica). In simple terms, the dollar is pegged to the price of gold. With how volatile gold prices have been in the last few years, it’s clear that such a system would not, in fact, guarantee price stability.\nThe system we currently have of inflation targeting is essentially like pegging the dollar to the price of the goods we consume. Such a system has brought us low, stable inflation for the last 3 decades. To be clear, a gold standard would keep prices from rising in the long term, but would make prices pretty volatile in the short term.\nIn summary, would you like a currency that is pegged to the price of the goods we actually buy, or one that is pegged to a metal?\nEconomic shocks could be disastrous A currency that’s pegged to something, whether a commodity or another currency, tends to be procyclical.\nUsually, when economies are growing too fast, central banks implement policies that aim to slow down this growth and tame inflation. Likewise, when economies are growing slowly (in recessions, for example), central banks implement policies that aim to increase the money supply and jolt the economy back to life. This is called counter-cyclical monetary policy, and it aims to make the natural economic cycles of booms and busts less severe.\nIn a gold standard, the central bank is not able to expand or contract the money supply. So, there’d be high inflation during economic booms, and disastrous, deflationary recessions during the busts that last for years.\nCase study: While the gold standard may have not caused The Great Depression, it made it drag on longer than it would have under a fiat currency system. The money supply in the US shrunk by a third during the depression, and countries that devalued their currencies or left the gold standard came out of the depression quicker.\nIs there enough gold in the world to return to the gold standard? The US’s gold reserves stand at about $450 billion (2021). This is against a monetary base of just over $6 trillion. The value of all gold ever mined in the world at current prices (August 2021) is over $9 trillion, so the US could theoretically return to a gold standard if they bought up gold from private citizens and the rest of the world. Such an operation would be incredibly expensive, if not downright impractical.\nThis mass purchase of gold would send its price skyrocketing: good for gold producers, but bad for industries that actually need the shiny metal, like electronics, and jewellery.\nLow, stable inflation in the last few decades has shown us that the government can be trusted The US has had stable inflation of 4% in the years after the Great Inflation, and around 2% in the last 10 years. With all the points I’ve mentioned above (showing that returning to the gold standard would be impractical), and with the fact that the current financial system has brought huge stability, is there really a need to go back to the gold standard?\nRelated: The rise of inflation conspiracy theories\n"},{"section":"Blog","slug":"/blog/inflation-conspiracy-theories/","title":"The rise of inflation conspiracy theories","description":"","date":"August 4, 2021","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/inflation-consp_hu_98ef268a6a192f74.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"275\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/inflation-consp_hu_8305e6bd19843ae1.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/inflation-consp_hu_ff62283ef02da7ad.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/inflation-consp_hu_bf81614d5688033b.png';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"","tags":"Economics, Inflation","content":"I watched a “documentary” a few days ago called End of the Road: How Money Became Worthless. One statement in the documentary stuck in my mind:\nThe purchasing power of the average person has been deteriorating drastically. But in order to disguise this, governments have been skewing the figures in their reports to make it seem as if inflation is much lower than it really is.\nThis is just one of many examples of inflation conspiracy theories. They have been gaining popularity over the last few years, more so on the onset of Quantitative Easing during the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe government, the theory goes, has many inflation-linked obligations and responsibilities like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and Inflation-Linked Bonds (ILBs). Thus, there’s an incentive to understate inflation figures.\nShadowStats, one company that recalculates inflation figures “the correct way”, claims inflation is actually at 13.5%. This is almost three times the official reported inflation of 5.4% (June 2021). Its author, Walter J. Williams, later admitted to adding an arbitrary constant to make inflation figures look higher than they really were! This is really obvious on their graph, as the two curves resemble the same shape:\nBut why does it sometimes seem like our personal experiences of inflation differ from official inflation figures?\nCalculating inflation is not as easy as you think It turns out that inflation is kind of hard to calculate. This is because inflation isn’t just about calculating how much prices have risen. It’s about calculating how much prices have risen for the same goods.\nThe thing is, the quality of goods improves over time.\nTake a smartphone for example. The price of iPhones has generally risen over the past decade, but this is because they have become better over the last decade. Screens have become bigger, new features are added (3D Touch, Face ID, etc.), and demand for smartphones has generally increased. It’s clear that inflation is not the only factor that has caused the price of iPhones to rise.\nThe reverse is also true:\nThe prices of some goods may stay the same, yet their quality is deteriorating. For example, instead of a firm increasing prices in line with inflation, it may reduce the size or quantity of the good. This is called shrinkflation, and it makes inflation harder to measure.\nAnother reason inflation is hard to measure is because people’s spending habits differ. The prices of goods don’t rise in tandem – different prices rise at different rates. The price of tertiary education, for example, has risen at a higher rate than the price of new cars. So, technically, every person’s personal inflation rate will slightly differ from the official reported one.\nSo, if you decided to privately track inflation, while your figure might be close, it probably won’t be exactly the same as official figures. It will be close though – probably not the 13.5% reported by ShadowStats. The Billion Prices ProjectTemplate is one example of a private estimate of inflation. An initiative by MIT and Harvard, they collected prices from online retailers on a daily basis, measuring their change over time to come up with an inflation rate. Their inflation rates were roughly identical to official rates.\nThe difficulty in measuring inflation, and the differences in the inflation rate each of us experiences, may be some of the reasons why some people fall into the inflation conspiracy theory trap.\n"}]
