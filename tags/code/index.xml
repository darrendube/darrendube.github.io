      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the late 70s and early 80s, inflation ravaged the US economy. The US had just been taken off the gold standard &lt;em&gt;temporarily&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Nixon in 1971, and in the years that followed prices rose up to 14% annually. Proponents of the gold standard saw this as proof that the government could not be trusted to regulate the money supply. In their view, vote-seeking politicians might print money, inducing short term economic growth, but causing inflation in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
